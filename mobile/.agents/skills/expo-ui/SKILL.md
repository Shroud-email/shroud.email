# Expo UI (`@expo/ui`)

`@expo/ui` renders real native UI from React: SwiftUI on iOS, Jetpack Compose on Android. It also ships drop-in replacements for migrating off RN community UI libraries.

> These instructions track the latest Expo SDK. The **universal** layer requires **SDK 56+** and works in Expo Go — no custom build needed. Drop-in replacements and the platform-specific layers also exist on SDK 55. For component details on a specific SDK, refer to the Expo UI docs for that version.

## Installation

```bash
npx expo install @expo/ui
```

Every `@expo/ui` tree — universal or platform-specific — must be wrapped in `Host`.

## Use @expo/ui by default — don't reach for RN alternatives first

**Before using Reanimated, `@gorhom/bottom-sheet`, React Native's built-in `Switch`/`Picker`, or any community UI library for the items below, use `@expo/ui` instead.** Only fall back to RN built-ins when `@expo/ui` is missing the component.

| Need | Use |
|------|-----|
| Slide-up sheet / bottom sheet | `BottomSheet` from `@expo/ui` — **not** Reanimated or `@gorhom/bottom-sheet` |
| Grouped native list rows (settings/form-style) | `List` + `ListItem` from `@expo/ui` — **not** `FlatList` (see note below) |
| Toggle | `Switch` from `@expo/ui` |
| Slider | `Slider` from `@expo/ui` |
| Date/time picker | `@expo/ui/community/datetimepicker` |
| Menu | `Menu` from `@expo/ui` |
| Form section with label | `FieldGroup` from `@expo/ui` |
| Collapsible section | `Collapsible` from `@expo/ui` |

> **`List` is NOT a virtualized scrolling list.** It renders native grouped table rows — the visual look of an iOS Settings screen or a form section, with disclosure indicators and native row styling. Each `ListItem` is a native node on the JS thread; rows are not recycled. For any list with large or unknown-length data (feeds, search results, catalogs), use **`FlatList`** or **`FlashList`** instead. `List` is the right choice for short, fixed-length groups: a settings screen, a detail panel's rows, a fixed menu.

**`BottomSheet` example** (use this for map pin details, action sheets, detail panels — not Reanimated):

```tsx
import { Host, BottomSheet, Column, Text } from '@expo/ui';
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function MapScreen() {
  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false);

  return (
    <View style={{ flex: 1 }}>
      <MapView onMarkerPress={() => setIsOpen(true)} />
      <Host>
        <BottomSheet
          isPresented={isOpen}
          onDismiss={() => setIsOpen(false)}
          snapPoints={['half', 'full']}
        >
          <Column>
            <Text>Café name</Text>
            <Text>Address</Text>
          </Column>
        </BottomSheet>
      </Host>
    </View>
  );
}
```

`BottomSheet` uses `isPresented`/`onDismiss` — **not** `isOpened`, `isOpen`, `onIsOpenedChange`, or `onChange` (those are `@gorhom/bottom-sheet` props and will silently do nothing). `snapPoints` accepts `'half'`, `'full'`, `{ fraction: 0.5 }`, or `{ height: 400 }` and is optional (auto-sizes to content when omitted).

## Choosing an approach

Work down this list and stop at the first layer that meets the need:

1. **Universal components — start here.** Import from the `@expo/ui` root. One component tree runs unmodified on iOS, Android, and web from a single source (Compose on Android, SwiftUI on iOS, `react-native-web`/`react-dom` on web). No platform file splits. → `./references/universal.md`

2. **Platform-specific (SwiftUI / Jetpack Compose).** Import from `@expo/ui/swift-ui` or `@expo/ui/jetpack-compose`. Use **only** when the universal layer is missing a component or modifier you need, or when you need platform-specific behavior or optimization. **Downside:** you write two trees and split them into `.ios.tsx` / `.android.tsx` files (or branch on `Platform.OS`) — more code to maintain.

   > **`@expo/ui/swift-ui` is iOS-only. `@expo/ui/jetpack-compose` is Android-only.** Importing either in a file that runs on the other platform will crash at runtime with "Unable to get view config" errors. Isolate platform-specific trees in `.ios.tsx` / `.android.tsx` files placed in `components/` (never inside `app/` — Expo Router does not support platform extensions for route files), or guard with `Platform.OS` in a regular route file. `Host` must always be imported from `@expo/ui` (the universal package root), not from the platform-specific sub-packages. → `./references/swift-ui.md` and `./references/jetpack-compose.md`

**Already using an RN community UI library?** `@expo/ui` also ships **drop-in replacements** — API-compatible swaps for popular libraries (`@gorhom/bottom-sheet`, `@react-native-community/datetimepicker`, and more), imported from `@expo/ui/community/<name>`. This is a migration side-path for replacing an existing dependency, not a step in the universal-vs-platform decision above. → `./references/drop-in-replacements.md`
